# Event Zapper - A way to Zap speakers at in-person events, in realtime

During live events, speakers often inspire, entertain, or educate the audience. What if the audience could instantly express their appreciation? This is where Event Zapper comes in. With Event Zapper, attendees can instantly "Zap" the speakers using [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) and the Bitcoin Lightning network.

With Event Zapper, event organizers can bridge the gap between audiences and speakers, making the event more lively, interactive, and memorable.
